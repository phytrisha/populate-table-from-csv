Export table from Excel as “.csv”

The table you have created in Figma needs to have the same amount of rows and columns

Next, check whether you…

…have created the table in figma grouped into “rows” (see screenshot below), then do *not* select the checkbox “columns” inside the plugin UI

… or grouped into “columns” (see screenshot below), then *do* select the checkbox “columns” inside the plugin UI

Next, click “Choose File” and upload the .csv file

Select the entire table inside of figma and click on “Populate” in the plugin UI
